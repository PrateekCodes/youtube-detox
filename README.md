# Youtube Detox
### 🧘‍♀️ *Get control over YouTube and be distraction free*

Youtube is great. I get to learn a lot from it, and I'm sure you all do too. But it can also be a huge time-sink, especially when you're getting bombarded with recommendations left, right, and center (quite literally). 😫 With Youtube Detox, you can change this. Start with a simple, minimalistic page that lets you search anything on Youtube directly without the distracting home-feed. 😎
For privacy enthusiasts, you can also use Youtube Detox to save your history locally and disable your account's Youtube History. 🔏
